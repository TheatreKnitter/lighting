# Olympic Lighting

Welcome to the Olympic Lighting Inventory. This site is an online updatatble database designed to help the lighting department at the Olympic games track how many lighting instruments they have, plus allocate them a locaion which can be changed as needed throughout the course of the games. The table is fully sortable, allowing the user to sort by instrument type, ID, manufacturer and by location.

The app makes use of a database hosted by MLabs which is accessed as the page is loaded. A simple API is used to make changes to the data and bootstrap is used to help create a more pleasant front-end experience.
